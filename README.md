# homework1

How to run:
1) Clone repository
2) Navigate in command line to homework1/src/
3) run: "node Uloha1Regex.js" in command line for the first example (this example uses regex)
  - output will be saved to outputData.json by default
5) run: "node Uloha1NoRegex.js" in command line for the second example (that doesn't use regex)
  - output will be saved to outputData.json by default

- you can change the output file within the js files
- in Uloha1NoRegex.js there is another example that can be accessed by uncommenting a line with input and a line in sortingFunction (and commenting the old one)
